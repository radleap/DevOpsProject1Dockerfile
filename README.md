# DevOps CICD

##  Project Overview
- See https:github.com/radleap/DevOpsProject1Ansible.git 

## General:
- This is the application/project that developers push code to.
	- Container Dockerfile for image and container creation
	- Container runtime exposes index.html on port 80.  
- This integrates with Jenkins via the plug and Jenkinsfile/playbooks.
- This is separate from the Jenkins/Ansible pipeline code by design.
